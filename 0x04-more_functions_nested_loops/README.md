# 0x04. C More functions, More nested loops
This project is to elaborate on the lessons from the previos nested loops projects.

* 1-isdigit.c (isdigit)
* 2-mul.c (Collaboration is multiplication)
* 3-print_numbers.c (The numbers speak for themselves)

* 5-more_numbers.c (Numbers constitute the only universal language)
* 6-print_line.c (The shortest distance between two points is a straight line)

### 0-isupper.c (isupper)
Write a function that checks for uppercase character, Returns 1 if c is uppercase and 0 otherwise. using the prototype ` int isupper(int c)`

### 1-isdigit.c (isdigit)
Writes a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9). with the prtotype `int isdigit(int c)`

### 2-mul.c (Collaboration is multiplication)
Write a function that multiplies two integers. With the prototype `int mul(int a, int b)`

### 3-print_numbers.c (The numbers speak for themselves)
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. Only using _putchar twice in the code with the prototype `void print_numbers(void)`

### 4-print_most_numbers.c (I believe in numbers and signs)
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. Using the prototype `Void print_most_numbers(void). Without printing 2 and 4, and using _putchar only twice.

### 5-more_numbers.c (Numbers constitute the only universal language)

### 6-print_line.c (The shortest distance between two points is a straight line)
### 7-print_diagonal (I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe)
### 8-print_square.c (You are so much sunshine in every square inch)
### 9-fizz_buzz.c (Fizz-Buzz)
### 10-print_triangles.c (Triangles)
### 100-prime_factor.c (The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important anduseful in arithmetic)
### 101-print_number.c (Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper)
