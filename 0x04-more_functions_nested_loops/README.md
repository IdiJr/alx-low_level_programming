### 0-isupper.c (isupper)
Write a function that checks for uppercase character, Returns 1 if c is uppercase and 0 otherwise. using the prototype ` int isupper(int c)`.

### 1-isdigit.c (isdigit)
Writes a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9). with the prtotype `int isdigit(int c)`.

### 2-mul.c (Collaboration is multiplication)
Write a function that multiplies two integers. With the prototype `int mul(int a, int b)`.

### 3-print_numbers.c (The numbers speak for themselves)
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. Only using _putchar twice in the code with the prototype `void print_numbers(void)`.

### 4-print_most_numbers.c (I believe in numbers and signs)
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. Using the prototype `Void print_most_numbers(void). Without printing 2 and 4, and using _putchar only twice.

### 5-more_numbers.c (Numbers constitute the only universal language)
Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line. With the prototype `void more_numbers(void)`, using _putchar only three times in your code.

### 6-print_line.c (The shortest distance between two points is a straight line)
Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal. With the prototype `void print_line(int n)`, using only `_putchar` function to print where `n` is the number of times the character `_` should be printed, ending with a new line, and if `n` is `0` or less, the function prints a new line.

### 7-print_diagonal (I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe)
Write a function that draws a diagonal in the terminal. With the prototype `void print_diagonal(int n)`, using only `_putchar` function to print where `n` is the number of times the character `\` should be printed, ending with a new line, and if `n` is `0` or less, the function prints a new line.

### 8-print_square.c (You are so much sunshine in every square inch)
Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line. With the prototype `void print_square(int size)`, using only the `_putchar` function to print, where `size` is the size of the square, if `size` is `0` or less prints only a new line, and using the character `#` to print the square.

### 9-fizz_buzz.c (Fizz-Buzz)
Write a program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.Each number or word should be separated by a space and You are allowed to use the standard library.

### 10-print_triangles.c (Triangles)
Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line. With the prototype`void print_triangle(int size)`, using only the `_putchar` function to print, where `size` is the size of the triangle, if `size` is `0` or less prints only a new line, and using the character `#` to print thetriangle.

### 100-prime_factor.c (The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important anduseful in arithmetic)
The prime factors of 1231952 are `2, 2, 2, 2, 37` and `2081`.
Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line. You are allowed to use the standard library and compiling the code with `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 100-prime_factor.c -o 100-prime_factor -lm`.

### 101-print_number.c (Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper) 
Write a function that prints an integer. using the prototype `void print_number(int n)`, using only the `_putchar` function to print, not using `long`, arrays or pointers, and any hard-code special values.
