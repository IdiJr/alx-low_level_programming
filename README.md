### 0x00. C - Hello, World
Introduction to C programming. includes how to write scrits in C programming and basic use of `printf`, `puts`, `sizeof`, `write`.

### 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
In this session, the use of arithmetic operators, boolean operators, logical operators and rational operators is explored. What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C. Also how to use comments, `if`, `if ... else` statements, declaration of variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` and assigning values to them.
How to print value of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`, with `printf`, the use of `while` loop, with variables and printing variables with `printf`. Knowing what the `ASCII` character set is and the purpose of `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`.

### 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
In this session, the use of nested loops, header files and functions were studied. The difference between declaration and definition of a function, scope of variables and `gcc` flags were also studied.

### 0x03. C - Debugging
In this session, how to debug in C programming was studied.

### 0x04. C -More functions, more nested loops
In this session, the concept of nested loops in `0x02. C - Functions, nested loops` were expanded.

### 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
In this session, the concept of pointers and arrays is introduced. The difference between pointers and arrays, their uses and also, what are strings and how to manipulate them.

### 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings
This session, is a continuation of the previous one `0x05-pointers_arrays_strings`

### 0x07. C- Even more pointers_arrays_strings
This session, is a continuation of the previous one `0x06-pointers_arrays_strings`

### 0x08. C - Recursion
In this session, we learn what recurssion is, how it is implemented, when to and when not to implement recursions.

### 0x09. C - Static libraries
In this session, we learn how to create static libraries to and how to use them.

### 0x0A. C - argc, argv
In this session, how arguments are passed in a program is learnt.

### 0x0B. C - malloc, free
In this session, the concept of automatic and dynamic memory allocation, malloc and free is explored.

### 0x0C. C - more malloc, free
In this session, the concept of automatic and dynamic memory allocation, malloc and free is expanded as a build-up on the previous topic `0x0B. C - malloc, free`.

### 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
In this session, the concept of macros is explored.

### 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef
In this session, the concept of structures, when and how they are used is explored.
