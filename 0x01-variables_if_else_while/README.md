### 0-positive_or_negative.c
This program assings random numbers to the variable `n` after each execution. the code prints whether the number in the variable `is positive`, `is negative`, or `is zero`.

### 1-last_digit.c
Prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and assigned to the variable `n` after the program is executed and tells:
* if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
* if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string `and is 0`
* if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6` and not `0`
