# 0x08-Recursion
This project contains tasks that were performed in order to understand the concept of recursion in C programming and how to impliment it.

### 0-puts_recursion.c (She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget)
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line. Using the prototype: `void _puts_recursion(char *s);`

### 1-print_rev_recursion.c (Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together)
Write a function that prints a string in reverse. Using the prototype `void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);`

### 2-strlen_recursion.c (Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange)
Write a function that returns the length of a string. Using the prototype `int _strlen_recursion(char *s);`

### 3-factorial.c (You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling)
Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number. Using the prototype `int factorial(int n);`. If n is lower than 0, the function should return `-1` to indicate an error, and Factorial of `0` is `1`.

### 4-pow_recursion.c (Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate)
Write a function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`. Using the prototype `int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);`, and If `y` is lower than `0`, the function should return `-1`.

### 5-sqrt_recursion.c (Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer)
Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number. Using the prototype `int _sqrt_recursion(int n);`,and If `n` does not have a natural square root, the function should return `-1`.

### 6-is_prime_number.c (Inception. Is it possible)
Write a function that returns `1` if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return `0`. Using the prototype `int is_prime_number(int n);`.

### 100-is_palindrome.c (They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything)
Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not. Using the prototype `int is_palindrome(char *s);`, and An empty string is a palindrome.

### 101-wildcmp.c (Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...)Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
Write a function that compares two strings and returns `1` if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return `0`. Using the prototype `int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);`, s2 can contain the special character *, and The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)
