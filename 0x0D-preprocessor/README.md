# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
This project was done to learn about what macros are and how to use them. the most common predefined macros and how to include guard header files.

## Table of contents
* 0-object_like_macro.h (Object-like Macro)
* 1-pi.h (Pi)
* 2-main.c (File name)
* 3-function_like_macro.h (Function-like macro)
* 4-sum.h (SUM)

### 0-object_like_macro.h (Object-like Macro)
Create a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

### 1-pi.h (Pi)
Create a header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

### 2-main.c (File name)
Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line. You are allowed to use the standard library

### 3-function_like_macro.h (Function-like macro)
Write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

### 4-sum.h (SUM)
Write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
