# 0x05-Pointers_Arrays_Strings
This project was done to learn how to use pointers, arrays and manipulation of strings.

## Table of contents
* 0-reset_to_98.c (98 Battery st.)
* 1-swap.c (Don't swap horses in crossing a stream)
* 2-strlen.c (This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read)
* 3-puts.c (I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them)
* 4-print_rev.c (I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear)
* 5-rev_string.c (A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes)
* 6-puts2.c (Half the lies they tell about me aren't true)
* 7-puts_half.c (Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half)
* 8-print_array.c (Arrays are not pointers)
* 9-strcpy.c (strcpy)
* 100-atoi.c (Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers)
* 101-keygen.c (Don't hate the hacker, hate the code)
