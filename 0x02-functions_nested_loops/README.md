# 0x02 Functions and Nested loops
This project is to explore functions and nested loops in C programming.

## Table of contents
* 0-putchar.c (0. _putchar)
* 1-alphabet.c (I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game)
* 2-print_alphabet_x10.c (10 x alphabet)
* 3-islower.c (islower)
* 4-isalpha.c (isalpha)
* 5-sign.c (Sign)
* 6-abs.c (There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you)
* 7-print_last_digit.c  (There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important)
* 8-24_hours.c (I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life)
* 9-times_table.c (Learn your times table)
* 10-add.c (a + b)
* 11-print_to_98.c (98 Battery Street, the OG)
* 100-times_table.c (The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself)
* 101-natural.c (Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women
)
* 102-fibonacci.c (In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A)
* 103-fibonacci.c (Even Liber Abbaci)
* 104-fibonacci.c (In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+)
